Resources for homeless deaths maps

The data here came from the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/homelessness/open-resources

I then geocoded the 2018 deaths and mapped them.

I used R to make the frames for the gif. Pretty sure there's a way to do similar in QGIS, but I sacked it off after half an hour of trying and reverted to what I know.
